In the following project (as part of advanced programming course), i created a system of Farm trades.     
The system contains 3 types of animal, while each type produce a different product.   
The system also contains farms, each farm can trade with another.     
Farms can subscribe one another if one is desiered in the products of the other.    
Hope you will enjoy the project!
